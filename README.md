##
This node package transforms our image data into readable bits and bytes, and then alters them bit by bit in either color, grayscale, or luminous style.

HOW TO GET STARTED:
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes.

PREREQUISITES:
FIRST, first set up your package.json (npm init and fill in your preferred information, or keep hitting enter like us!). This will give you your package.json.
SECOND, install npm mocha, eslint (npm i mocha eslint -D). This will create your package-lock.json. The node modules "mocha" and "eslint" will be installed and set as your dependencies.
THIRD, Create a file called README.md. This can be done manually or when you make your repository.
FOURTH, Add a .gitignore file (which will ignore the cumbersome node_modules file).
FIFTH, Add an .eslintrc and a .eslintignore file.
SIXTH, Add a .travis.yml file.
